# In Klipper, skew correction is a feature designed to address and correct 
# mechanical inaccuracies in 3D printers that lead to skewed or misaligned prints. 
# This feature is particularly useful when the X and Y axes of a printer are not perfectly perpendicular, 
# which can cause printed objects to have distorted dimensions or non-square corners.
